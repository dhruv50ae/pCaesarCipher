## Description

- Has the option to encode and decode
- Words come from an array
- Can choose shift amount up to plus or minus infinity
- Used the (%) operator to uncap the shift amount rather than loops
## What I learnt

- Using the % operators decreases Big O value rather than looping ✅
- Variables after getting user input ✅
- Can use modules ✅
- Built-in methods ✅
- Debugging using StackOverflow and Google ✅
## How To Use

- Enter encode or decode in exact form, then enter the word or set of words you want to use in the cipher, enter shift amount.
- There is no catch for errors, so the application might break if there are any misinputs
